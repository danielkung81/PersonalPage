**To DAT 502 – Introduction to Statistical Computation Students:**

We need to install R, and RStudio.

To use R, we’ll need to download two software packages: R, and RStudio. R is the basic software which contains the R programming language. RStudio is software that makes R programming easier. Of course, they are totally free and open source.

<li>Download R [here](https://www.r-project.org/);</li>
<li>Download RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (choose the free version).</li>

**R Markdown** provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both
<li>save and execute code</li>
<li>generate high quality reports that can be shared with audiences</li>

R Markdown are fully reproducible and support dozens of static and dynamic output formats. In order to use R Markdown, you should install the RStudio in advance.

Read more about R Markdown here: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html

**Note**: All assignments must be turned in electronically and will involve writing a combination of code and actual prose. **You must submit your assignment using R Markdown**. 
Both the **.Rmd** and **.html** should be submitted. Work submitted in any other format will receive an automatic grade of 0, without exceptions. 
Every file you submit should have a file name which includes your first and last name, and clearly indicates the type of assignment and its number. For example, *LiangKong_quiz1.Rmd, LiangKong_quiz1.html*.
