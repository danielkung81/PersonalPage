# Research Interests
I am intrigued by qualitative studies of nonlinear evolution equations that occur in life sciences, with a focus on understanding the global and dynamical structure of solutions. 
	Moreover, I am currently exploring the interplay between dynamical systems and machine learning. 
	If you are a UIS student who shares similar interests in either or both of these areas, please do not hesitate to contact me for potential research opportunities.<br>
